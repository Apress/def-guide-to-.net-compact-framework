To minimize the size of this Samples file, the SQL Server CE database NorthwindDemo.sdf was removed from the individual project folders.

You will find a copy of this database with the Inventory sample project that is included with the .NET Compact Framework. By default you would find this file at:

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\CompactFrameworkSDK\v1.0.5000\Windows CE\Samples\VB\Inventory

You will need to either:

a) include this file into the appropriate projects
b) copy the database to \Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Apress on your test environment.
